Project For Weblog Astronomy.

# 🌠 Why astronomy?
Because I was interested in astronomy, I put a project about news, planets, and many things in astronomy into this project, that's why I came and made my project into this project.

# 🧑‍💻 What is project programming?
🎯This project is with Django, maybe it says html inside the GitHub label, but this project is with Django language.🎯

# 📦 How to installation file requirements.txt, virtualenv:
First, go to the Astronomy directory and write this command:
```
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Command for [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/):
```
$ pip install virtualenv
```
And then it will install the package for you. If there is a problem somewhere, be sure to let me know in the [issues](https://github.com/Programmingmonth/Weblog/issues) section so that I can solve the problem quickly.
